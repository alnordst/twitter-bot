# twitter-bot

## What is this?

A twitter bot to solve some silly problems.

I wanted train updates but only for the train I care about, so I'm making a bot that will periodically perform particular searches and retweet the ones I care about.

## Instructions

Make a twitter account and go to (apps.twitter.com)[apps.twitter.com] and make an app and whatnot. Then put your authentication stuff into **auth.py**.

Next you'll need a **config.json** file to tell it what to do. My next step will be designing a GUI to build one.

Once that's set up, you'll just want to run **botscript.py** periodically.
